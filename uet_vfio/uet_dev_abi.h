/*
 * L2 ring configuration (guest writable)
 *
 * Two rings of uet_dev_desc carry ordinary Ethernet frames between the guest
 * and the wire, so the device can host a netdev beside the UET datapath.
 * The device demultiplexes its interface. UET traffic goes to the uet
 * instance, everything else (ARP, ICMP, ND, DHCP, etc) crosses these rings.
 *
 * Index discipline, the same for both rings:
 *
 *   - The guest owns the producer index and publishes it by writing
 *     TX_PROD/RX_PROD in this BAR. That write is the doorbell and the
 *     value is the new producer index.
 *   - The device owns the consumer index and publishes it in BAR0
 *     TX_CONS/RX_CONS, then raises the ring's MSI-X vector.
 *   - A slot is owned by the device when (cons != prod).
 *
 * Indices are free running u32 counters, not wrapped. The slot is
 * (index % entries), entries must be a power of two and no more than
 * UET_DEV_RING_MAX_ENTRIES.
 *
 * TX: The guest fills addr/len with a frame to send. The device reads the
 * frame and writes it to the wire. Nothing is written back to the descriptor,
 * TX_CONS is the completion.
 *
 * RX: The guest posts empty buffers, len being the capacity. The device
 * writes a received frame into addr, then writes the descriptor back with
 * len set to the actual frame length and UET_DEV_DESC_DONE set. Frames
 * larger than the posted buffer are dropped and counted, never truncated.
 *
 * Rings must be physically contiguous and are only read while the ring's
 * ENABLE bit is set. Disabling a ring is how a driver takes its memory back.
